# Online-Pharma


The Online Pharma website should allow the users to create a new account (if a new user) else allow them to login into their account. Once logged in, the user can add the medicines he/she needs to the cart. 
 
A new user should first sign up and create a new account in order to be able to purchase medicines. 
     o ​ ​Once the account has been created he/she can login and follow the below procedure.
      
Upon clicking on login button or any button that requires the customer to be logged-in <br />
     1)    Open the login/register page <br />
     2)    Enable logging-in [user-id, password]. <br />
     3)    Upon successful login, the user can navigate to the page having the list of medicines that can be purchased. <br />
     4)    Upon failure, redirect to exception processing (retry, forgot password or register).<br />

User selects the medicines that he/she wants to purchase and adds them to the cart.   
     1) User can select the quantity of the medicine and also the rates will be mentioned below.(Total amount of the purchase will be   calculated).  <br />

Apart from the User Interface the Admin will have access to the Master Database wherein he can get the details of all the customers who have registered on the website as well as the details of the medicines that they have purchased.
